A Look into all Aviation upsets since 1948 to 2022.

Introduction:

Welcome to my first of many repository dedicated to analyzing aviation upsets using SQL. This project marks an important step in my journey to mastering SQL and data analysis techniques. By leveraging a raw dataset encompassing aviation incidents from 1948 to 2022, specifically targeting instances of upsets, I aim to gain valuable insights while practicing my skills and knowledge in SQL querying and data manipulation.

Dataset Description:

The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of aviation upsets, offering rich information for analysis. It includes various attributes such as flight details, environmental conditions, aircraft types, locations, fatal Injuries ,and outcomes of the incidents.

Objective:

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into aviation upsets over the past decades. By using SQL queries, I aim to uncover patterns, trends, and potential factors contributing to these incidents. Understanding the underlying causes of upsets can facilitate proactive measures for enhancing aviation safety.
